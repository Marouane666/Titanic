# Titanic Data Science Solution

The notebook walks us through a typical workflow for solving data science competitions at sites like Kaggle <br>

## Workflow stages

1. Data importation <br>

2. Data visualization and analysis <br>

3. Machine Learning <br>

<p>The workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other </p>

1. We will import the dataset with all the libraries that we will work and manipulate the data with <br>

2. We will visualize the pattern in the data and the correlation within <br>

3. We will use the preprossed data to predict the test set with differente models <br>

<H2>Workflow goals</H2>

1. We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.<br>

2. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features <br>

3. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. <br>

4. Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature <br>

5. We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors <br>

6. Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals. <br>

7. How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals. <br>
